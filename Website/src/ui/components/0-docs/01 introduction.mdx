# Introduction to the Design System

A [Design System](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/guide-to-design-systems/) is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow one or more teams to design, realize and develop digital products.

The system you in right now is part of the overall design system. 
This system is focused on the technical components and documentation for building digital products. Outside of this system lies elements such as brand and visual design guidelines, wireframes etc.

The library is structured using [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles. A pattern for breaking down digital products into reusable components.

## Why do we need a design system?

### Consistency

Create a common set of principles, resources, and components to improve consistency and user experience across the digital product or products.

* Creates a single source of truth for digital product teams
* Improves quality as a result of documented and applied standards
* Improves user experience as a result of consistent components, design interactions, and patterns

### Efficiency

Develop a unified system, with the appropriate governance applied, to increase the speed at which new or improved components can be developed, and reduce duplication.

* Improves velocity for designers and developers working across projects
* Frees up time to focus on innovation through new technology and frameworks
